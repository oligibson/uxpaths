## Contribute

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

These are not rules, just guidelines that you can follow in order to keep the repository as clean as possible. But if you don't have time to follow all of it, no worries, just create a pull request and I'll make the modifications myself if needed.

And if you think there is a better way to organize this repo, please do not hesitate to share your point of view.

1. Add a folder to the `src` directory, for the type of example you want to show, for instance `sign-up` or `login`.

2. Add a folder to the `src/sign-up` directory with the name of the app or website you are showing, for instance `twitter`.

3. Add the images to this folder and number them in order of the pages.

4. Add a `tile.html` and a `modal.html` file to the same folder, use the code in other folders as example.

5. Run `grunt` to generate the `index.html` file before committing.
